To generate results for Federated Deep Generalized Method of Moments (FedDeepGMM), run main.py.

Dataset Information We evaluated the performance of Federated DeepGMM using different optimizers on various datasets, categorized as follows:

Low-dimensional datasets: step, abs, and linear functions. High-dimensional datasets: femnist-x, femnist-z, and femnist-xz.

Both datasets can be generated by running: generate_zoo_data.py (for low-dimensional datasets) generate_mnist_data.py (for high-dimensional datasets)

Learning Rate Configuration for Optimizers Different learning rates are used for optimizing the g and f functions depending on the dataset and optimizer.
